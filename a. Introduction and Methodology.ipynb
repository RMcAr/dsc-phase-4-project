    "### Problem 4: Natural Language Processing (NLP)\n",
    "If you choose this option, you'll build an NLP model to analyze Twitter sentiment about Apple and Google products. The dataset comes from CrowdFlower via data.world (Links to an external site.). Human raters rated the sentiment in over 9,000 Tweets as positive, negative, or neither.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to:\n",
    "\n",
    "Build a model that can rate the sentiment of a Tweet based on its content.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Aim for a Proof of Concept\n",
    "There are many approaches to NLP problems - start with something simple and iterate from there. For example, you could start by limiting your analysis to positive and negative Tweets only, allowing you to build a binary classifier. Then you could add in the neutral Tweets to build out a multiclass classifier. You may also consider using some of the more advanced NLP methods in the Mod 4 Appendix.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Evaluation\n",
    "Evaluating multiclass classifiers can be trickier than binary classifiers because there are multiple ways to mis-classify an observation, and some errors are more problematic than others. Use the business problem that your NLP project sets out to solve to inform your choice of evaluation metrics."

    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this investigation, as stated above, we will be buliding a Natural Language Processing Model to analyze Tweet/Twitter sentiment (predicting both overall customer base sentiment and individual tweet sentiment?). \n",
    "We need to build a model that can:\n",
    "- Rate the sentiment of a Tweet based on its content.\n",
    "    - Rate suggests that we should have a scale of classes that we can throw tweets into, then maybe see where the positive, negative tweets fall on that scale accdn. to our model, and then incorporating our neutral classed tweets for a tuning method. \n",
    "    - Sentiment suggests we are attempting to measure happiness, but specifically the happiness of those who are tweeting about either Apple or Google products. Our dataset is provided with classifications Positive, Neutral, and Negative, which is as far as we need to proceed according to the task provided. \n",
    "       - Something interesting would be a regression task which scales tweets' sentiment from 0 to 10 and we construct the net promoter score for apple products vs iphone products, comparing these two companies in a really interpretable way. \n",
    "   - Content of the tweet needs to also be broken down. How will we define the content? We can construct our data for modelling from our tweets 'content' by:\n",
    "       - Feature Engineering ; each of these gives a different 'perspective' on words whether looking context or content. \n",
    "           - Bigrams & Mutual Information Score\n",
    "           - Parts Of Speech Tags\n",
    "           - Word2Vec engineering \n",
    "           \n",
    "Now that we have fully parsed out all the possible interpretations of our task, let us begin with investigating our data. \n",
